# [Hello World! by Polkadot](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/polkadot/onboard?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hello+world)

**Gitcoin has integrated [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) and [Kusama](https://kusama.network/) tokens (DOT and KSM) into its tech stack**, making them one of the first full integrations outside of the Ethereum ecosystem.

To celebrate the integration on Gitcoin, we are organising **[Hello World! by Polkadot](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/polkadot/onboard?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hello+world)**, a series of challenges to bring you on a journey of Polkadot development discovery.

**[Check out the kick-off webinar for more details and information.](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/gitcoin-hello-world-by-polkadot)**

## Challenges and prizes 

The challenges are in four categories: (1) Beginner, (2) Intermediate, (3) Advanced, and (4) Ecosystem. The first three are written specifically for Polkadot and Kusama, whereas the Ecosystem category is made up of challenges created by Polkadot ecosystem projects. Challenge payouts are capped at 50, meaning that only the first fifty valid submissions will receive a payout.

| Challenge  | #  | Prize  | Cap  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Beginner  |  7  | 3 DOT  |  50 |
| Intermediate  | 5   | 1 KSM  | 50  |
| Advanced  | 4  | 10 DOT  | 50  |
| Ecosystem  | 8   | 5 DOT  | 50  |

### **In addition, there is an EXTRA PRIZE of 150 DOT for the first 50 that manage to complete 18 or more challenges.**

Everyone successfully solving any challenge and receiving a payout will also get an awesome piece of Polkadot swag as well as a Kusama-based NFT, issued via [RMRK](https://rmrk.app/).

## Deadlines
- Open registrations: October 8th
- Challenges go live: October 15th
- Duration: 4 weeks
- End: November 12th, or after all challenges are solved
- Prize distribution period: up to two weeks after the event
